Don't kill them all.

--Bob Ross



PJ: Lets go to La Tolteca.

Pete: You've gotta roll the R's.

PJ: What R's?

Pete: In "La Tolteca".

PJ: There are no R's in La Tolteca.

Me: Its spelled just how it sounds.

Pete: Oh. Then its not an authentic Mexican restaraunt?

PJ: Because it has no R's?

Pete: Yeah.
